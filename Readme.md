# README: Iris Species Prediction Project

## Overview

This project demonstrates a basic machine learning application by building a model to predict iris species. The dataset used in this project contains measurements of iris flowers, including the length and width of their petals and sepals. The goal is to predict the species of an iris flower based on these measurements using a supervised learning approach.

## Project Description

### Background
A hobby botanist has gathered measurements from iris flowers, focusing on four key features:
- Petal length (in cm)
- Petal width (in cm)
- Sepal length (in cm)
- Sepal width (in cm)

She also has access to data from an expert botanist, who has labeled these flowers as one of three species:
- *Iris setosa*
- *Iris versicolor*
- *Iris virginica*

Using this labeled data, the goal is to create a machine-learning model that can predict the species of new iris samples based on their measurements.

### Objectives
1. **Understand Core Concepts**: This project introduces fundamental machine learning concepts, including data preparation, model training, and evaluation.
2. **Build a Simple Predictor**: We will develop a prediction model using a basic algorithm and evaluate its performance on the iris dataset.
3. **Make Predictions**: After training the model, we will use it to predict the species of new iris flowers.

## Dataset

The dataset contains 150 samples of iris flowers, with the following structure:
- **Features**:
  - Sepal length (cm)
  - Sepal width (cm)
  - Petal length (cm)
  - Petal width (cm)
- **Target**:
  - Species: *setosa*, *versicolor*, or *virginica*

### Data Source
The data used in this project is well-known as the Iris dataset, which is publicly available and often used for demonstrating machine learning techniques.

## Implementation Steps

1. **Data Loading**: Load the iris dataset and inspect its structure.
2. **Data Preprocessing**: Clean and prepare the data for model training, including splitting it into training and testing sets.
3. **Model Selection**: Choose a simple machine learning algorithm (e.g., k-nearest neighbors, decision tree) to build the predictor.
4. **Model Training**: Train the model using the training data.
5. **Model Evaluation**: Evaluate the model's performance using the testing data and appropriate metrics (e.g., accuracy, confusion matrix).
6. **Predictions**: Use the trained model to predict the species of new iris samples.
